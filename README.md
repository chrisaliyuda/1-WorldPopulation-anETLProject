# Designing a 2023 Population Database - An ETL Process
This is a simple Extract, Transform and Load process which is aimed at pulling the world population from a website (source), performing data transformation and loading to a database. 
The whole process was performed using Python programming language. 
Check [here](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) for the website in which the data was pulled.
The image below shows a snapshot of the loaded data in ElephantSQL Data Warehouse
